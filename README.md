# What is it about

Detailed information about AXA clinics in Singapore, so that we can further make
use of the data

The data is in the file `clinics.json`. Note that some of the file doesn't
contain a location information (around 20 records). Would need a cleanup in
future

# Demo

Google map is used to show the clinics, [see here](http://flyfy1.github.io/axa_clinic.json/)

If the data is not shown via Google Map.. it might because that the usage
limited is exceeded. In that case, you can clone the `gh-pages` branch and run
it locally
